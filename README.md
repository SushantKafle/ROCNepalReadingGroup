===============================

Welcome to the Rochester Nepal Reading Group! We are a group of Machine Learning (ML) enthusiasts from a diverse field-of-study interested in the recent advancements in theoretical ML and the subsequent applications. You'd like to participate in our weekly discussion, please check our schedule. We meet every week on Wednesday evening at the Golisano College of Computing at the Rochester Institute of Technology, unless otherwise specified.
